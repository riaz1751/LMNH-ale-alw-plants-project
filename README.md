# LMNH Plants Project

This project for the Liverpool Museum of Natural History takes in readings every minute
for each of the plants being monitored, and loads them into a short term & long term archive
for data analysis & visualisations.

# Deliverables
- A full data pipeline, hosted in the cloud (using the specific tech listed below)
- A short-term database solution that can store the full data for the past 24 hours
- A long-term archive solution for data older than 24 hours
- Some form of visualisation for the data
